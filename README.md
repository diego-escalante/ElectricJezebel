 ```

4. Start up Unity, and open the ElectricJezebel project.

#### Ludum Dare Entry

This game was originally made for Ludum Dare 31 in three days. It was built around the theme *Entire Game on One Screen*. You can play the original game in all its glory (and flaws) [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=46754). Or you can dive into the original project on [this branch](https://github.com/diego-escalante/ElectricJezebel/tree/LD31_version) of the repo.
